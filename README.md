# Multimode Fiber Image Reconstruction (ML/AI Models)

This project explores **image-based machine learning models** for reconstructing images transmitted through multimode optical fibers.  
The goal is to test and compare the performance of different ML/AI models for multimode fiber input–output image reconstruction based on the loss.
